Local auto and taxi networks refuse to allow Ola/Uber to operate in their area, fearing slavery, diminished income, and the loss of ownership and independence. 
In addition to the aforementioned issue, corporate companies refuse to allow the driver and user to communicate directly and retain 25% of the entire amount paid by the client to the driver.

Our proposed system aims at eliminating middlemen, and establish **direct (P2P) connection** between the user and driver. This is achieved throught the following tech stack:

- Ethereum (Blockchain Network)
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Truffle, Ganache and MetaMask (Interface between website and Blockchain Network)
- React.js (Frontend)
- Firebase (Cloud-based login system)
